## gobas schema

Generate a schema library package

### Synopsis



gobas schema reads types from an xsd file and generates go structs and
encoders/decoders for various formats.  It is meant to be used in conjunction 
with the generated client and service packages.  The generated code should
not be edited!  The entire package is clobbered on schema updates.

```
gobas schema <xsd-file>
```

### Options

```
      --to string   output directory (default "schema")
```
